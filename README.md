# Airbnb-Owner-Database
SQL Database for Property Owners on Airbnb
Summary
Airbnb is one of the most popular vacation stay apps/companies used today. Millions of people use this app to help find the perfect home for their vacation instead of staying in a hotel. Although Airbnb is focused on its users, there is another side of the platform that could benefit greatly from an updated database. To help with the process of those renting out these rooms, homes, properties I will be creating a database to ease tracking and figuring out costs. 

Stakeholders
Property Owners
Real Estate Investors
Airbnb Board Members

Business Rules
Every property owner has to have at least 1 or more property able to rent out. 
Property owners must let renters know what type of property they will be renting. For example: house, part of the house, apartment etc. 
Each property has to be able to be rented out to at least 1 or more renters. The property owner has to state how many rooms/bathrooms are available on each property and how many guests are allowed to stay there. 
Renters can also do a long term rent of the property if the property owner allows. 

Data Questions
Who are the people buying properties to rent out?
How many properties do they own?
Who rents the properties?
How much does the average property go for per month?
